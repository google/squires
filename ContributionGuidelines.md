# Introduction #

Contributions and enhancements to Squires are most welcome, however we ask that you following the following guidelines.

# Code requirements #

Squires follows the [Google code style](http://code.google.com/p/soc/wiki/PythonStyleGuide). Please ensure your patches adhere to this.

Your changes should include updates to unit tests. We want to keep broad code coverage.

# Legal #

If you are not a Google employee, our lawyers insist that you sign a Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA).

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html). Individual CLAs can be signed electronically.
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

The Google CLA is based on Apache's. Note that unlike some projects (notably GNU projects), we do not require a transfer of copyright. You still own the patch.

Sadly, even the smallest patch needs a CLA.
